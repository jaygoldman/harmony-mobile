# App Icon Asset Bundle

Generated by `yarn icons:ios`.

## Contents

- `ios/default`: Standard fully opaque PNGs for every required iOS size.
- `ios/dark`: Dark-appearance variants that swap in a deeper background gradient while keeping the glyph white.
- `ios/tinted`: Monochrome PNGs with transparent backgrounds for iOS 18 tinted icons.
- `source`: SVG masters (`master`, `knockout`, `dark`, `tinted`) that feed the exporter.

## Regenerating

1. Ensure dependencies are installed (`yarn install`).
2. Update `assets/images/brand/conductor-mobile-icon.svg` for the default icon and `assets/images/brand/conductor-mobile-icon-knockout.svg` for the dark/tinted glyph if the artwork changes.
3. Run `yarn icons:ios` from the repository root.

The command rewrites the PNG outputs in-place. Bring the files into Xcode by dragging the relevant sets into `AppIcon.appiconset`, mapping `~dark` and `~tinted` variants to the new appearance slots.
